# Hebrew_Twitter_Harmfull_Speech_Classification

Text classification (also known as text tagging or text categorization) is the process of categorizing text into organized groups. By using Natural Language Processing (NLP), text classifiers can automatically analyze text and then assign a set of pre-defined tags or categories based on its content.
 
Given a dataset containing Hebrew posts from social media, we predict whether a post has violent sentiment (tag == 1) or not (tag == 0).
 
The output will be a text\csv file which contains a single column with the prediction (0 or 1) for each one of the test samples.
Each prediction in the output file should be in a separate row.
 
We consider the test data as an UNSEEN dataset, which is available only for calculating your predictions
